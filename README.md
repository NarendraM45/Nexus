## 🗺 App Walkthrough

**Splash & Onboarding**  
The app opens with a cinematic 8-second animated splash — a pulsing purple hero Lottie plays center-screen over gently floating orbs, a typewriter subtitle fades in, and a mini rocket Lottie sits at the bottom. First-time users are routed to a 3-slide swipeable onboarding carousel with gradient overlays and smooth-page indicator dots. Returning users skip directly to the home screen.

**Authentication**  
Login and Signup are wrapped in a glassmorphic card that floats over a dolphin Lottie background. Both screens use `flutter_form_builder` with real-time validation, email/password autofill hints, and a shake animation triggered on invalid submit attempts. A success Lottie overlay celebrates a completed login before routing to the loading screen.

**Home Dashboard**  
A personalized greeting dynamically adapts to time-of-day (Good morning / afternoon / evening). Below sits a feature grid of quick-access tiles, a recent activity feed, and animated metric rings — all with staggered fade-in entry animations via `flutter_animate`.

**Navigation**  
A hand-crafted 3D Compass widget serves as the persistent bottom navigation bar with arc-geometry icon positioning across routes. Every screen also exposes a Lottie hamburger icon in its AppBar that slides open a full glassmorphic side drawer with the user avatar, profile stats, navigation links, and a one-tap Logout.

**Tasks & Calendar**  
Tasks are displayed as swipeable cards with priority color-coding, completion rings, and due-date chips. The Calendar tab integrates `table_calendar` with a bottom sheet for quick task creation from any selected date.

**Team**  
The Team screen shows a live member directory with online presence indicators (animated pulsing green dot), role chips, and `CachedNetworkImage` avatars with shimmer placeholders. Tapping a member opens a detail sheet with skills, task count, and contact info.

**Explore, Notes & Analytics**  
Explore features an animated search bar that expands from 60% to full width on focus. Notes uses a masonry staggered grid. The Analytics tab drives `fl_chart` bar and line charts with smooth animated data entry.

State follows a strict **state class → notifier class → provider declaration** separation throughout. All navigation goes through `context.go()` / `context.push()` — no raw `Navigator` calls except inside `useRootNavigator: true` sheets.
